										Both, consumption and investment are explained in small portion by fundamental shocks in the short run
										(5 and 11 percent during the first year) with an increasing path until achieve a participation 
										around 18 percent in the long run. On thw other hand, the global shocks looks be more
										determinant on production explaining more than one quarter of the total variability
										with a maximum after 8 quarters (above 40 percent).
									<p> 
										The effect on financial related variables -	effective real exchange rate, and monetary policy interest rate 
										is higher and appears more promptly, with an instantaneous contribution of 42 and 59 percent, respectively, 
										(28 and 56 percent after 8 quarters). In the long term, the predictability of these variables
										are driven by fundamental global shocks by around 20 and 40 percent respectively. Their contribution in 
										trade balance volatility is small in comparison with the previous described result, with an increasing path
										and a final share of 13 percent.
									</p>
									<h3>Canada</h3>
									<p>
										<span class="image right"><img src="images/Figures/Countries/FEV_mec8.svg" alt="Canada" /></span>
										During the first two years, global shocks has less effect over consumption rather than
										investment and total output, with an explanation power that achieved 12 percent.
										In the same period, the effect on the GDP variability starts close to 18 percent (39 percent 
										for investment) to finish around 38 percent (and 50 on investment). In the long run, investment 
										on Canada is the most explained real variable among the selected ones, with an exposure of
										31 percent (26-13 for output and consumption). The patterns exhibit by them are on par with 
										the rest of developed economies, reflecting the velocity in the absorption of future information
										that occurs in these countries.
									</p>
									<p>
										On the other hand, the volatility of interest rates explicated by fundamental (global) shocks 
										exhibits a similar behavior with an initial value of 59 percent,  a maximum of 68 percent after 
										one year decreasing until more than 40 percent of the total variability.
									</p>
									<h3>New Zealand</h3>
									<p>
										<span class="image left"><img src="images/Figures/Countries/FEV_mec9.svg" alt="New Zealand" /></span>

									<p>
										In almost all the considered countries; approximately, one quarter of monetary policy dynamics were
										tied to fundamental global innovations. However, interest rates fluctuations seems more exposed
										in the Norway economy, where around one third of its volatility is due to these conditions. Unlike
										this, the rest of their aggregates exposed similar long run explained levels of variance (close to
										20 percent) regards other small open developed markets.

									<h3>Norway</h3>
									<p>
										<span class="image right"><img src="images/Figures/Countries/FEV_mec10.svg" alt="Norway" /></span>
									</p>
									<p>
										Norway predictability response to global shock shows two particularities. 
										First, the portion of trade balance explained by these innovation is the highest among
										the developed economies with a long run contribution above one third, and a maximum of almost 
										one half after one year.(This result has the same flavor than Colombian's results and it is because
										both are mostly crude oil exporter 45, and 59). Second, the global shock contribution on exchange rate 
										variability has an increasing pattern, which differs respect the rest of developed countries (but again
										on par with colombian results)
									</p>
									<p>
										Both, consumption and production are mostly affected in the medium run with a fraction of 0.53 and 0.26 
										of their fluctuation explained by these shocks. in The long run they drive around one third of GDP
										volatility and 22 percent for consumption. Finally, their participation on investment is between the range 18-24
										percent during the horizon.
