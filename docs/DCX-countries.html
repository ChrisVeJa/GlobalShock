										During the analysed horizon a small fraction of Australian's consumption is explained by global shocks 
										starting from 1 percent until achieve a participation around 18 in the long run. On the other hand, 
										they look to be more relevant to determine production volatility, explaining more than one quarter
										of its variability with a peak after the two years (above 30 percent). The effect on effective real exchange 
										rate is higher and faster, with an instantaneous contribution about 36 percent, 
										which reduces drastically during the first two years to below 20 percent and finish close to 17 percent. In the 
										Canadian case, global shocks have lower effects over consumption than investment and total output, 
										with an explanation power that achieves 13 percent for consumption. The instantaneous effect on the GDP variability 
										is closed to 18 percent (39 percent for investment) and finish explaining near to one quarter (and 30 on investment)
										of the economic fluctuations. In the long run, investment. The patterns exhibited by these variables are on par with 
										the rest of developed economies, reflecting the velocity in the absorption of future information that occurs 
										within the bloc.
									</p>

										As in the rest of developed economies New Zealand's real interest rate depends on global fluctuations by around 20 percent
										achieving a stable level slowly. On the other hand, the contributions on investment and production 
										show a high volatility, with a participation around 26, and 18 percent after two years from when it is almost constant.
										There is one peculiarity to comment from the results for New Zealand aggregates: the explanation power
										of global innovations on consumption and real exchange rate presents a decreasing-increasing path starting 
										from 18/15 percent to reduce until 14/8 after one year, after that they raise and achieve an explained
										volatility about 20 percent. Finally these shocks drive , in the long run, 14 percent of the trade balance 
										movements.

										Norway predictability response to global shocks shows two particularities. First, the fraction of trade balance predictability 
										explained by these innovation is the highest among the developed economies with a long run contribution close to 30 percent, 
										and a maximum of almost 38 after one year.(This result has the same flavor than Colombian's results and it is because
										both are mostly crude oil exporter 45, and 59). Second, the global shock contribution on exchange rate 
										variability has an increasing pattern, which differs respect the rest of developed countries. Finally, consumption and production 
										forecastability are mostly affected in the medium run with a fraction of 0.41 and 0.32 
										of their fluctuations driven these shocks; while, their relevance in the long run is around 30 and 25 percent, respectively.
