										Both, output and investment are explained in small portion by fundamental shocks in the short run
										with an increasing path until achieve a participation around 13 percent for the later and 15 for
										the former. The explanation power on consumption has not presented a remarkable variability being
										in the range [7-13] percent. In contraposition, the effect on financial related variables -
										effective real exchange rate, and monetary policy interest rate looks to appears more promptly,
										with an instantaneous contribution of 17 and 19 percent, respectively. After 40 quarters they are
										stabilized around 20, and 25 percent becoming them into the variable with a highest response in this
										economy.

									<h3>Canada</h3>
									<p>
										<span class="image right"><img src="images/Figures/Countries/FEV_GSCan.svg" alt="Canada" /></span>
										During the first two years, global shocks has more effect over consumption rather than
										investment and total output, with an explanation power that comes from 50 to 28 percent.
										In the same period, the effect on the GDP variability starts close to 35 percent (40 percent 
										for investment) to finish around 18 percent (and 29 on investment). In the long run, investment 
										on Canada is the most explained real variable among the selected ones, with an exposure of
										16 percent (12-13 for output and consumption). These results contrast drastically respect the rest 
										of countries belong to this group. For this economy the absorption of future information occurs  
										in the two first quarters - reflecting in the sharp hump of their FEV paths.
									</p>
									<p>
										On the other hand, the volatility of interest rates explicated by fundamental (global) shocks 
										exhibits a similar pattern with an initial value of 24 percent,  a maximum of 37 percent after 
										one year decreasing until one quarter of the total variability. The Canadian's exchange rate
										displays the highest uncovering amid selected developed countries.
									</p>
									<h3>Norway</h3>
									<p>
										<span class="image left"><img src="images/Figures/Countries/FEV_GSNrw.svg" alt="Norway" /></span>
									</p>
									<p>
										In the long run, we can recognize two clusters in Norway variables. On one side, 
										the output and consumption shows that 20 percent of their fluctuations are described by global
										innovations; on the other side, global shocks just explain 13 percent of the rest of variables.
										A second difference resides in the shape that the contribution of global innovations exposes.
