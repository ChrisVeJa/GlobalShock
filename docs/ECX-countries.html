										<h2>Emerging Commodity Exporters</h2>
									</header>
									<h3>Argentina</h3>
									<p> 
										<span class="image left"><img src="images/Figures/Countries/FEV_GSArg.svg" alt="Argentina" /></span> 
										With an initial contribution of 15 and 8 percent on output and consumption fluctuations, global shocks
										shows an increasing path over the first 4 years achieving a participation around 30 percent for these aggregates
										and 25 percent on investment. This result reduces until 23 percent, and 20 percent respectively. 	
										On the other hand, global shocks explains near one quarter of interest rate volatility raising as fast as
										3 quarters after the fundamental shock hits. Trade balance and real exchanges rates are the variables less explained 
										by global shocks with a relevance closes to 15 percent.
									</p>
									<h3>Brasil</h3>
									<p> 
										<span class="image right"><img src="images/Figures/Countries/FEV_GSBra.svg" alt="Brasil" /></span>
										The influence of fundamental global conditions in the macro aggregates for the Brazilian economy is similar 
										to the reported in the case of Argentina, with a long run explanation power of 23 percent, but these level are 
										reached faster (for output we can see that it is mostly constant over the horizon). The lower relevance on trade
										variables is more visible here being lower than 15 percent in the first three year to raise slowly converging 
										to 19 percent after one decade.
									</p>
									<h3>Chile</h3>
									<p> 
										<span class="image left"><img src="images/Figures/Countries/FEV_GSChl.svg" alt="Chile" /></span> 
										Chile's results display a clearly hump shaped for almost every domestic variable. 
										Global shocks' participation peaks is rapidly reached after 4 quarters
										being a driver for almost half of the volatility of output and consumption, while 30 percent for investment.
										Surprisingly, in  a long horizon, the fundamental shock accounted for around 21 percent of the economy
										fluctuations, which is similar to aforementioned countries. A main feature of these outcomes is a high
										effect on trade balance, that could reveal a vital role for an international trade channel.
									</p>
									<h3>Colombia</h3>
									<p> 
										<span class="image right"><img src="images/Figures/Countries/FEV_GSCol.svg" alt="Colombia" /></span> 
										The long run effect of global innovations on Colombian macro aggregates are comparable with 
										the most countries (around 22 percent for consumption and GDP, while 15 percent for trade and real exchange rate). 
										Their instantaneous contribution in investment is the smallest among the selected developing economies,
										reflecting the high sunk cost required in petroleum industry. Indeed, the low transmission into consumption and 
										GDP could evince the timing to complete the pass-trough of crude-oil prices into the economy.
									</p>
									<h3>Peru</h3>
									<p> 
										<span class="image left"><img src="images/Figures/Countries/FEV_GSPer.svg" alt="Peru" /></span>
										Peruvian's exposure to global shocks are on par with Chilean results in the medium horizon, but apparently they differ 
										in the channel that leads to this point. While for the later almost a quarter of the economy variability is
										supported by movements in global conditions being the trade channel an important one; for the former, 
										it looks not be the case since only 15 percent of the trade balance and real exchange rate fluctuations are 
										related with global shocks. In the long run, the Peruvian economy registers the highest vulnerability
										with almost one third being explained by world shocks. 
									</p>
									<h3>South Africa</h3>
									<p> 
										<span class="image right"><img src="images/Figures/Countries/FEV_GSSoA.svg" alt="SouthAfrica" /></span>
										Among all the analysed emerging economies, output and investment in South Africa are the lowest affected 
										by fundamental global shocks (18 and 14 percent in the long run), while consumption is closer to the rest 
										of economies (21 percent). In contrast, global shocks exhibits a stellar role (regarding other ECXs) in
										real exchange rate behavior with a contribution that oscillates between 29-31 during the whole horizon. A last
										point to remark is the path of the explanation power in interest rates that shows a low reduction during the first 
										year after the innovation, which is totally opposite respect with the rest of countries -both, developed and emerging.

										<b> 
											Here I will point out the similarities in trade structure and how this ones could explain in some extend
											what we see. for example, brazil and argentina are similar and both export grains, while peru and chile trade
											mining (mainly cooper but peru also gold). In the other hand, the high exposure of the exchange rate for soa could
											reflect a low level of trade in futures for their commodities (platinium and iron) while the low effect on colombian
											reer is petroleum. Talk about asymmetry response in REER
