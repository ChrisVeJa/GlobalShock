										<h2>Emerging Commodity Exporters</h2>
									</header>
										Brazil and Argentina, are the economies whose exports are main based on soybeans (41 and 22 percent), but the
										contribution of global shocks show different pattern in both cases. For the Argentinian economy the impact of fundamental global shocks exhibits a hump shape reflecting not only the persistent nature of the shock but also 
										a "slow" adjustment in the economy.	In quantitative terms it explains around one quarter of short run volatility of output 
										and investment, reaching its peak after 2 years when its contribution is around 45 percent for these aggregates
										and 34 percent on consumption. In the long run this shock drives 25, 30 , and 22 percent of the forecastibility 
										for these variables. The participation of global shocks on international trade and  interest rate reports an increasing pattern 
										which reaches their maximum promptly ( in the case of interest rate, it pass from 9 to 16 percent in the first quarter)
										, and then having an explanation power around 20 percent.

									<p> 
										In the Brazilian case, global conditions drives around 20 percent of the long run forecast volatility for 
										output, consumption, and effective exchange rate; while, 11-16 percent in the rest of variables. 
										In contrast to Argentina, the dynamics does not show a hump shape for the main variables. Instead, the
										impact is higher in the short run and medium run, representing 44 and 33 percent at the same period and 
										close to 30 percent after 2 years of the predictability on output and consumption. Another difference are the 
										shape of the participation on FEV for financial-related variables (exchange rate and interest rate), reporting an almost
										share on effective exchange rate between 14-20 percent in the whole horizon achieving 18 percent during the first year.
									</p>
									<p>
										The following two markets are exporter mainly of energetic product. In the left panel the results for Colombia whose
										exports are basically composed by crude oil (45) percent and in the right panel I present the contribution in the 
										South African economy which exports mainly coal (23 percent), but also platinum (21 percent). 
									</p>
									<p>
										For the former, the long run effect of global innovations is around one third of its output fluctuations, 
										and near to 42 percent on investment volatility, and one-quarter for consumption. For both economies, the dynamics of 
										these contributions show a hump shape pattern with their maximum in the neighborhood of the sixth quarter, 
										accounting around 60 percent of the forecastibility in output and investment in the Colombian and, and one half
										in the later. This result could be reflecting the high concentration of Colombian trade, but the same is not showing for the 
										Chilean economy where cooper represents 70 percent of their exports is cooper). A remarkable difference between these economies is 
										the long run share of global shock; since, for the South African market global innovations only determines one fifth of the
										forecast volatility (10 percent smaller than Colombia).

										Finally, the remaining economies based their exports on mining product; while Chile register 
										a share of cooper above 70 percent, Peruvian exports are concentrated in two goods, cooper and gold (34 and 29 percent, respectively)
										The contribution of global shocks on Chile's production displays a clear hump shaped pattern with an initial impact of 9 percent which
										promptly reaches its peak after 6 quarters decreasing until 15 percent in a long term. 
										In the same horizon about 15 percent of consumption and investment fluctuations are driven by these shocks, however their dynamics are different.
										in the short run for consumption is small (with a peak after 8 quarters). As in the Brazilian case, global shocks account for almost 18 percent of exchange rate
										variability in the first year, increasing slowly during next years to be stabilized around a 20 percent.
									</p>
									<p>
										The exposure of Peruvian production to global shocks are on par with the Chilean results in the medium horizon 
										but differ in long terms with Peru exhibits a higher contribution of these innovations. It could be caused by
										a difference in the transmission channels that lead to this point. While for Peru almost 30 percent of the economy 
										variability is supported by movements in global conditions being the trade channel and investment important ones 
										(a contribution around 21 percent in the long run), for Chile it looks not be the case since only 13 percent of the
										trade balance and 16 percent of investment fluctuations are related with global shocks, which drive just a half regarding 
										to the Peruvian case. As before, the difference in exporting structure are critical to find a source of difference.
										Although for both countries the most important product is copper, gold is also relevant for Peru. Therefore, we have in one
										hand the outstanding performance of China explaining the low relevance of global shocks in the Chilean Case, the role of 
										gold as financial asset in the world makes that Peru faces a bigger impact of these innovations.
