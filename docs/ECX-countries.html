										<h2>Emerging Commodity Exporters</h2>
									</header>
									<h3>Argentina</h3>
									<p> 
										<span class="image left"><img src="images/Figures/Countries/FEV_Country1.svg" alt="Argentina" /></span> 
										With an initial contribution around 25 and 23 percent on output and investment fluctuations, global shocks
										shows an increasing path over the first 2 years achieving a participation around 45 percent for these aggregates
										and 34 percent on consumption. These results are reduced close to 25 percent, and 30 percent respectively
										(with 22 percent on consumption). The impact of fundamental global shocks exhibits a hump shape reflecting not 
										only the persistent nature of the shock but also a "slow" adjustment in the economy.
									</p>
									<p>
										On the other hand, global shocks explains near 18 percent of interest rate volatility raising rapidly (the
										first quarter pass from 9 to 16 percent) after the fundamental shock hits. In contrast, the effect 
										over real exchanges rates are close to be constant suggesting small frictions in the international trade
										in this country. A remark to do is that effective exchange rates are more related to fundamental shocks
										in the short and long run (it could be explained by higher movements in the spot market and not in the 
										future one, but we lack of data to make this statement). 
									</p>
									<p>
										The previous results, including the fact that the consumption and trade balance channels are small in the 
										short run indicates that ....
									</p>
									<h3>Brasil</h3>
									<p> 
										<span class="image right"><img src="images/Figures/Countries/FEV_Country2.svg" alt="Brasil" /></span>
										Fundamental global conditions impact on macro aggregates 
										for the Brazilian economy is close to 20 percent in the long-run for 
										output, consumption, and effective exchange rate; while, around 11-16 percent
										in the rest of variables. At difference with Argentina, the dynamic of 
										does not present a hum shape in the first two variables. Instead, the
										impact is higher in the short run and medium run (44 and 33 percent at the same period and 
										close to 30 percent after 2 years), 
									</p>
									<p>
										On the other hand, monetary policy response is the smallest (in the long run)
										among the analysed  economies with a explanation power
										near to 12 percent, and below two digits in the first three years. Another 
										particularity of Brazilian economy is that effective exchange rate displays 
										being determined between 14-20 percent in the whole horizon achieving 18
										percent during the first year.
									</p>
									<h3>Chile</h3>
									<p> 
										<span class="image left"><img src="images/Figures/Countries/FEV_Country3.svg" alt="Chile" /></span> 
										The contribution of global shocks on Chile's production displays 
										a clearly hump shaped pattern with an initial impact of 9 percents which
										promptly reaches its peak after 6 quarters decreasing until 15 percent in a long 
										term. In the same horizon about 15 percent of consumption and investment fluctuations
										are driven by these shocks, however their dynamics are different; while the impact
										in the short run for consumption is small (with a peak after 8 quarters) 
										, it is higher for investment contributing for 15 percent in the same shock period.
									</p>
									<p>
										As in the Brazilian case, global shocks account for almost 18 percent of exchange rate
										variability in the first year, increasing slowly during next years to be stabilized around a 20 percent 
										. Interest rates follows the same behavior as the rest of emerging countries. On the other side, the 
										response of trade balance is slow but increasing over as the time pass achieving a share around 15
										 percent after two years. 
									<h3>Colombia</h3>
									<p> 
										<span class="image right"><img src="images/Figures/Countries/FEV_Country4.svg" alt="Colombia" /></span> 
										The long run effect of global innovations on Colombian macro aggregates are 
										around  one third of its output fluctuations, and near to 42 of investment variability
										being explained by them, while they accounts for one quarter on consumption. 
										The dynamics of this contributions shows an hump shape
										with their maximum in the neighborhood of the sixth quarter - close to 60 percent (later I will show if these
										results are stable). The contribution on investment is the highest among
										the emerging economies studied reaching at maximum level around 63 percent. This result
										could be reflecting the high concentration of their trade on crude oil (near 45 percent 
										), and at difference with Chile (70 percent of their exports is cooper) the low 
										relevance of the Chinese economy in the petroleum market made that investor took more
										into consideration world movements. It is echoed in the impact on trade which achieved 
										50 percent after one year and 34 after a decade.										
									</p>
									<h3>Peru</h3>
									<p> 
										<span class="image left"><img src="images/Figures/Countries/FEV_Country5.svg" alt="Peru" /></span>
										Production Peruvian's exposure to global shocks are on par with Chilean results 
										in the medium horizon but they differ in long terms. It could be caused by 
										a difference in the transmission channels that lead to this point.
										While for the former almost 30 percent of the economy variability is supported by movements 
										in global conditions being the trade channel and investment important ones (a contribution around 21 percent
										in the long run); for the later, it looks not be the case since only 13 percent of the 
										trade balance and 16 percent of investment fluctuations are 
										related with global shocks, which drive just the a half regarding to the Peruvian case.
										As before, the difference in exporting structure are critical to find a source of difference.
										For the Peruvian economy although copper is the most important commodity, also gold is a 
										relevant player with a participation in exports around 30 percent, which is well know
										to works almost as a financial asset, and following closely the global conditions.

									<h3>South Africa</h3>
									<p> 
										<span class="image right"><img src="images/Figures/Countries/FEV_Country6.svg" alt="SouthAfrica" /></span>
										Among all the selected developing economies, global shocks have a high importance in the
										fluctuation of interest rates, explaining near to 40 percent of them in the long run.
										The rest of variables exhibit similar patterns than before, with 
										output volatility being explicated by 27 percent in the long run, while consumption 
										and investment report level aroun 18 percent.
