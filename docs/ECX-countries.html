										<h2>Emerging Commodity Exporters</h2>
									</header>
									<h3>Argentina</h3>
									<p> 
										<span class="image left"><img src="images/Figures/Countries/FEV_mec1.svg" alt="Argentina" /></span> 
										With an initial contribution of 25 and 21 percent on output and investment fluctuations, global shocks
										shows an increasing path over the first 2 years achieving a participation around 40 percent for these aggregates
										and 34 percent on consumption. These results are reduced until 25 percent, and 30 percent respectively
										(with 22 percent on consumption). The impact of fundamental global shocks exhibits a hump shape reflecting not 
										only the persistent nature of the shock but also a "slow" adjustment in the economy.
									</p>
									<p>
										On the other hand, global shocks explains near 18 percent of interest rate volatility raising rapidly (the
										first quarter pass from 9 to 16 percent) after the fundamental shock hits. In contrast, the effect 
										over real exchanges rates are close to be constant suggesting small frictions in the international trade
										in this country. A remark to do is that effective exchange rates are more related to fundamental shocks
										in the short and long run (it could be explained by higher movements in the spot market and not in the 
										future one, but we lack of data to make this statement). 
									</p>
									<p>
										The previous results, including the fact that the consumption and trade balance channels are small in the 
										short run indicates that ....
									</p>
									<h3>Brasil</h3>
									<p> 
										<span class="image right"><img src="images/Figures/Countries/FEV_mec2.svg" alt="Brasil" /></span>
										Fundamental global conditions impact on macro aggregates 
										for the Brazilian economy is close to 17-18 percent in the long-run for 
										output, consumption, and effective exchange rate; while, around 13-14 percent
										in the rest of variables. At difference with Argentina, the dynamic of 
										does not present a hum shape in the first two variables. Instead, the
										impact is higher in the short run and medium run (38 and 31 percent at the same period and 
										20 percent after 2 years), 
									</p>
									<p>
										On the other hand, monetary policy response is the smallest (in the long run)
										among the analysed  economies with a explanation power
										near to 13 percent, and below two digits in the first three years. Another 
										particularity of Brazilian economy is that effective exchange rate displays 
										being determined between 14-19 percent in the whole horizon achieving 18
										percent during the first year.
									</p>
									<h3>Chile</h3>
									<p> 
										<span class="image left"><img src="images/Figures/Countries/FEV_mec3.svg" alt="Chile" /></span> 
										The contribution of global shocks on Chile's production displays 
										a clearly hump shaped pattern with an initial impact of 9 percents which
										promptly reaches its peak after 6 quarters decreasing until 18 percent in a long 
										term. In the same horizon about 15 percent of consumption and investment fluctuations
										are driven by these shocks, however their dynamics are different; while the impact
										in the short run for consumption is small (with a peak after 8 quarters) 
										, it is higher for investment contributing for 16 percent in the same shock period.
									</p>
									<p>
										As in the Brazilian case, global shocks account for almost one third of exchange rate
										variability in the first year, reducing during the next years to be stabilized around a 18 percent 
										. Interest rates follows the same behavior as the rest of emerging countries. On the other side, the 
										response of trade balance is slow but increasing over as the time pass achieving a share of
										12 percent with a maximum contribution close to 16 percent after two years. 
									<h3>Colombia</h3>
									<p> 
										<span class="image right"><img src="images/Figures/Countries/FEV_mec4.svg" alt="Colombia" /></span> 
										The long run effect of global innovations on Colombian macro aggregates are comparable with 
										the most countries (around 22 percent for consumption and GDP, while 15 percent for trade and real exchange rate). 
										Their instantaneous contribution in investment is the smallest among the selected developing economies,
										reflecting the high sunk cost required in petroleum industry. Indeed, the low transmission into consumption and 
										GDP could evince the timing to complete the pass-trough of crude-oil prices into the economy.

									<h3>Peru</h3>
									<p> 
										<span class="image left"><img src="images/Figures/Countries/FEV_mec5.svg" alt="Peru" /></span>
										Peruvian's exposure to global shocks are on par with Chilean results in the medium horizon, but apparently they differ 
										in the channel that leads to this point. While for the later almost a quarter of the economy variability is
										supported by movements in global conditions being the trade channel an important one; for the former, 
										it looks not be the case since only 15 percent of the trade balance and real exchange rate fluctuations are 
										related with global shocks. In the long run, the Peruvian economy registers the highest vulnerability
										with almost one third being explained by world shocks.

									<h3>South Africa</h3>
									<p> 
										<span class="image right"><img src="images/Figures/Countries/FEV_mec6.svg" alt="SouthAfrica" /></span>
										Among all the analysed emerging economies, output and investment in South Africa are the lowest affected 
										by fundamental global shocks (18 and 14 percent in the long run), while consumption is closer to the rest 
										of economies (21 percent). In contrast, global shocks exhibits a stellar role (regarding other ECXs) in
										real exchange rate behavior with a contribution that oscillates between 29-31 during the whole horizon. A last
										point to remark is the path of the explanation power in interest rates that shows a low reduction during the first 
										year after the innovation, which is totally opposite respect with the rest of countries -both, developed and emerging.

											Here I will point out the similarities in trade structure and how this ones could explain in some extend
											what we see. for example, brazil and argentina are similar and both export grains, while peru and chile trade
											mining (mainly cooper but peru also gold). In the other hand, the high exposure of the exchange rate for soa could
											reflect a low level of trade in futures for their commodities (platinium and iron) while the low effect on colombian
											reer is petroleum. Talk about asymmetry response in REER
