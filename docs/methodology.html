										<h1>Global shock identification</h1>
									</header>

									<p> In the previous section I pointed out the tight relationship between <i> "news-augmented"</i> commodities
										price shocks and global shocks, and that we need to test if both generates a similar patron and/or if are 
										the same. To achieve this objective, we should find a identification strategy that allows to clearly 
										isolated global shocks. In that line, I first define what is understood as a <b> global-shock</b> for the
										scope of this paper
										<dl>
											<dt>
												<b>
													<strong> Definition 1:</strong> 
													<i>
														Let \(y^f\) being the observables that compound the foreign economy. A global shock is an 
														underlying innovation related to primitive drivers that induces a persistent co-movement 
														in every variable that belong to this block.
													</i>
												</b>
											</dt>
										</dl>
										This definition implies certain characteristics when we talk about a <b> global -shocks</b>:
										<ol>
											<li>A global shock is defined in the whole foreign economy. Then, any identification strategy should take
												into consideration that theoretically domestic variables are not are reliable source for pinning down. 
											</li>
											<li>The nature of the shock is not predefined, without any narrating is not possible define them as demand, 
												supply, technology or another. In this sense, I have to recognize the possibility that we are still 
												accounting some class of reduced shock but at the same time it allow us to have more flexibility.
											</li>
											<li>Being related to "primitives" although is a vague statement, for the scope of the paper entails that 
												these innovations are a main driver in the external-block variability
											</li>
										</ol>
									</p>

									<p>
										Here talk about how it is related to current literature and approach for global trends/shocks/ similar
									</p>

									<h2>Estimation Strategy</h2>
									<p> Let \(y_t^f\) and \(y_t\) be vectors of foreign and domestic variables, respectively. The reduce form for the two blocks VAR is 
										$$ 
										\begin{bmatrix} y^{f}_t \\ y_t \end{bmatrix}
										=
										\begin{bmatrix} B_{11,1} & 0 \\ B_{21,1} & B_{22,1} \end{bmatrix}
										\begin{bmatrix} y^{f}_{t-1} \\ y_{t-1} \end{bmatrix}
										+
										\begin{bmatrix} B_{11,2} & 0 \\ B_{21,2} & B_{22,2} \end{bmatrix}
										\begin{bmatrix} y^{f}_{t-2} \\ y_{t-2} \end{bmatrix}
										+
										\begin{bmatrix} \epsilon^f_{t} \\ \epsilon_{t} \end{bmatrix}
										$$
										Following the standard literature I choose two lags (the AIC and SIC are reported in the appendix), restricting 
										any parameters associated with an effect from the small open economy to the global block, which is a condition
										for identification since it avoids any possible feedback - and hence, power explanation. 
									</p>
									<p>
										The estimation is made by restricted OLS to obtain a initial point for the bayesian draws. As it is common in
										this class of modelling, I opt for a diffuse inverse-Wishart prior conditioning the selected draws for <b>B</b>
										to be stable. It means that we are estimating a cointegrated-VAR for each country in the sample. This procedure 
										gives similar results regards to a bootstrapping approach. The number of stationary simulations that we used is 5000
										(larger than usual amount used) 
									</p>
									<p>
										<b> Here mention what approaches there are in the literature and why we choose it</b>
									</p>
									<p>
										This approach is repeating in every analysed country (I will describe them as the data sources later).
										I divide the countries in two groups: (i) Emerging commodity exporters (ECX), and (ii) Developed commodity exporters.
										Since both kind of countries have different develop level of financial markets, there could be a different coverage until
										idiosyncatric shocks and have more enforcement power to prevent excessive volatility in capital flows .... 
										<b> Here explain more about the differences between these groups mentioning literature</b>
									</p>
									<p> The standard treatment to report average measure in aggregate groups take the IRFs and FEVD results for every country specific
										VARs and then calculate their average and construct its confidence band based on a combination
										of country-specific variance. In contrast, I collect all the realization for IRFs and FEVDs, reporting 
										their median and percentiles. It has two advantages over the common way. In one hand, reporting the median is possible which 
										can deal with extreme values; on the other, the confidence set are not required to be symmetric which enriches our analysis.

									<h2>Identification of Global Shocks</h2>
									As global shocks are related with persistent conditions and under the assumption
									of forward looking households I can exploit the framework develop by Uhlig (2003),
									by generalized it for a group of variables. 
								</p>
								<p> 
									In standard models a news-shock is identified
									as the innovation that explains at maximum the forecast error variance of an specific 
									variable. In contrast, my generalization defines an identification vector \(\gamma\)
									as the underlying driver with maximum participation in the future not predicted
									movements for an entire block. In a VAR with a exogenous economy the maximization problem is:
								</p>
								<p> 
									$$
										\begin{aligned}
										& \underset{\gamma}{\text{max}}
										& & \sum_{i \, \in \, y^f}\frac{S^{i}(\underline{\tau},\overline{\tau}|\gamma)}{S^{i}(\underline{\tau},\overline{\tau})}
										\\
										& \text{s.t.}
										& & \gamma' \gamma = 1 \\
										& & & \gamma(i) = 0 \ \forall \ i \not\in y^f
										\end{aligned}
									$$
								</p>
								<p>
										The objective function is the average contribution of \(\epsilon_\gamma\) on
										the FEV, I am assuming an equal weight for each variable in the foreign
										block but it can easily be extend to the case with different ones. While the
										first condition is assuring a unique identified vector, the second restriction 
										is imposed to ensure that our identified response vector has an extraneous
										source. Since the two block VAR is based on theory, the loss of information
										is minimal, and indeed it helps to pin down the correct structural parameters.
								</p>
								<p> After some algebra this problem can be reexpressed as:
									$$
										\begin{aligned}
										& \underset{\gamma}{\text{max}}
										& & \gamma' \xi \gamma \\
										& \text{s.t.}
										& & \gamma' \gamma = 1\\
										& & & \gamma(i) = 0 \ \forall \ i \not\in y^f
										\end{aligned}
									$$
									with \(\xi = \sum_{i\in y^f}\left(\prod_{j \in y^f_{-i}}S^{(i)}(\underline\tau, \overline \tau)\right)\Lambda^{(i)}\)
									and its solution is the eigenvector related to the maximum eigenvalue of \(\xi\).
