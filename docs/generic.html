										<h1>Introduction</h1>
									</header>
									<p> The current literature recognizes the relevance of commodities prices movements for small open economies.
										The terms of trade (approximated by ratio of export price index and the import price index) have been considered
										one of the main drivers in the observed growth for countries like Chile, and Peru in recent years (both mining exporters)
										with a outstanding copper price due China's developing process. 
									</p>

									<p>	
										<i><b>Here talk about some commodity price literature.</b></i> 
									</p>
									
									<p> 
										However, this result has been questioned by some authors. In example, Schmitt - Grohe and Uribe 
										(2017, henceforth SGU) with annual information about 38 emerging countries found that commodities shocks 
										are responsible for only 10 percent of domestic variables fluctuations, and when the real exchange rate channel
										is turning off, the impact is reduced to 2 percent. On the other hand, their results have some flags that 
										I comment. First of all, the unique variable considered in the external block was ..., meaning an implicit
										assumption of commodity price being a sufficient statistic for the external information, it generates two caveats: 
										<b> (i) </b> the volatility of external real variables and financial ones is not tracing directly and many channels
										are not considered, and 
										<b> (ii)</b> prices could summarize  the economic information if there are not frictions in the market, even if we
										can argue that commidities are trade in markets close to be competitive, the existence of financial instruments 
										related with them gives a playrole to information assymetries.
										Therefore, this assumption is not as harmless as we could think.
									</p>
									<p>
										In a certain way, Zeev,Pappa, and Vicondoa (2017) partially addresses them. They use a set of of 5 LATAM countries
										and identifies a  <b>news-augmented</b> commodity price shock by medium run identification (Uhlig, 2003) estimating 
										a contribution of commodities to domestic variables aroumd 49 percent. They understanding regards why SGU obtained low 
										levels is that commodities have also a financial role and their pricing takes into account future information, then 
										a short run identification neglects in measuring their total impact. Although, they have a valid point, their
										identification strategy faces some issues.

									<p> In order to clarify it, we need to mention two caveats. First, the above described models lack of a well defined
									external block which should (i) be exogenous and (ii) represent a global economy, that means we need to include a proxy
									of global economic activity in addition to commodities prices and monetary conditions variables. Intuitively, a global
									economy that does not satisfy (i) could create a artificial stronger effect of the medium run identification regards a
									Cholesky scheme, since commodities prices can be explained by spurious drivers (domestic variables), reducing its own
									prediction power and (in consequence) its forecast variance decomposition share over the rest of the system. Meanwhile,
									models that ignore (ii) omit the pricing process of commodities considering them as exogenous variables. In relation
									with this point, if we include some index of world production or other global real-variable, we can enrich the
									understanding about our models and overcome some possible external validation. For example, its clear that the stellar
									growth of China's GDP have influenced the increase of copper price in recent years or that the financial crisis affected
									commodities prices, properly, a model which does not include these event misses explanation power. The second caveat is
									deeper, using medium run strategy and calling the estimated innovation as \textit{news-augmented term of trade} shocks
									have several profound connotations. On the one hand, medium run strategy is a way to find a \textit{structural} shock
									that explain as high as possible fluctuations over a specific variable $x$, at the moment when we relate this identified
									shock only with $x$ we are trying to become $x$ into a exogenous variable -but not completely. On the second hand,
									calling these shocks as ``news" shock of $x$ causes an misapprehension since people could thinks that these news are
									only for the variable $x$, in this sense is not possible to track the origin of agents expectation changes in our models
									maybe implying and incomplete identification.</p>
									<p> In fact, our hypothesis is based on two central assumptions (related with previous ideas): a) there is not a only
									source for changes in agents beliefs, and b) is unavailable distinct perfectly what percent of the expectation changes
									correspond to each source. Given these, we can imagine that contemporaneous movements in global variables are correlated
									and also there is a common global component which synthesize all this information and can be defined as the main driver
									of global fluctuations. On this way, in section 2 we will extend the common medium run methodology to identify this main
									driver then we call it as a global optimism shock. Section 3 </p>>
