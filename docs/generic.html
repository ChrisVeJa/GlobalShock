										<h1>Introduction</h1>
									</header>
									<p> The current literature recognizes the relevance of commodities prices movements for small open economies.
										The terms of trade (approximated by ratio of export price index and the import price index) have been considered
										one of the main drivers in the observed growth for countries like Chile, and Peru in recent years (both mining exporters)
										with a outstanding copper price due China's developing process. 
									</p>

									<p>	
										<i><b>Here talk about some commodity price literature.</b></i> 
									</p>
									
									<p> 
										However, this result has been questioned by some authors. In example, Schmitt - Grohe and Uribe 
										(2017, henceforth SGU) with annual information about 38 emerging countries found that commodities shocks 
										are responsible for only 10 percent of domestic variables fluctuations, and when the real exchange rate channel
										is turning off, the impact is reduced to 2 percent. On the other hand, their results have some flags that 
										I comment. First of all, the unique variable considered in the external block was ..., meaning an implicit
										assumption of commodity price being a sufficient statistic for the external information, it generates two caveats: 
										<b> (i) </b> the volatility of external real variables and financial ones is not tracing directly and many channels
										are not considered, and 
										<b> (ii)</b> prices could summarize  the economic information if there are not frictions in the market, even if we
										can argue that commodities are trade in markets close to be competitive, the existence of financial instruments 
										related with them gives a play-role to information asymmetries.
										Therefore, this assumption is not as harmless as we could think.
									</p>
									<p>
										In a certain way, Zeev,Pappa, and Vicondoa (2017) partially addresses them. They use a set of of 5 LATAM countries
										and identifies a  <b>news-augmented</b> commodity price shock by medium run identification (Uhlig, 2003) estimating 
										a contribution of commodities to domestic variables around 49 percent. They understanding regards why SGU obtained low 
										levels is that commodities have also a financial role and their pricing takes into account future information, then 
										a short run identification neglects in measuring their total impact. Although, they have a valid point, their
										identification strategy faces some issues.
									</p>
									
									<p> 
										<span class="image left"><img src="images/mot1.PNG" alt="" /></span>
									
										The most obvious is if the news-augmented commodities shocks has precisely only information regarding movements in prices 
										(we could think if this shocks are itself orthogonal with the not identified shocks in the foreign block). At maximum, it 
										would be a problem of labeling (leading a mixing between channels, mechanisms and source that I talk later), but in order to this
										to happen, we need to consider commodities prices as sufficient statistics for the external implicit economy.
									</p>
									
									<p>
										The last implies a second aspect, which is more theoretical. Lets imagine that effectively commodities price can span all the 
										information of the global economy, an automatic question is what are the authors identifying? By construction, a medium run 
										identification approach will isolate a shock that could explain in maximum the cumulative prediction error variance, as it is 
										the same information that the whole block it would be considered as a global shock. Then, if it would be possible to have a refinement
										in the identification of this global shock, the results should not show significant differences with the original and it also should be
										the main determinant for commodity prices variability. One example of the previous mentioned lines is easily notice when we see 
										figure 1, it
