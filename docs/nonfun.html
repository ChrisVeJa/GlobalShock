										<h1>Non-Fundamental shocks</h1>
									</header>
									<p>
										In the previous section we saw how global conditions drive small open economies fluctuations explaining a substantial portion of them.
										Now, we want verify if this shock is also explaining mostly of the predictability of commodity prices. If this is the case, then we can not
										argue that real term of trade are a sufficient statistics for the world economy and models can use them and expect a good tracing and reliable
										results.
									</p>
									<p>
										To achieve that, we need to identify a second shock that is only related with commodity prices. This innovation should be at the same time: i)
										orthogonal with the global shocks (for a correct identification), and ii) explain most of the possible predictability of terms of trade. The
										last condition is imposed to  ensure that our test is sensible. 
									</p>
									<header class="main">
										<h2>Identification</h2>
									</header>
									<p>
										As before, I will use a modified version of the common medium run identification approach, setting the following maximization problem
									</p>
									<p> 
										$$
											\begin{aligned}
											\varphi* = & \quad \underset{\varphi}{\text{argmax}}
											& & \varphi' \Lambda^{(i)} \varphi \\
											& \text{s.t.}
											& & \varphi' \Psi = 1\\
											& & & \varphi'\gamma = 0 \\
											& & & \varphi'(z) = 0 \ \forall \ z > n^*
											\end{aligned}
										$$
										where \(\Lambda^{(i)}\) is the cumulative forecast error variance in the interval \([\overline\tau: \underline\tau ]\) of commodity-based terms of 
										trade. As before the first condition ensures an unique identification, the last one that only external variables explain commodity prices, and the
										second one asks for orthogonality with respect to the global shock. The solution to this system takes the form:
										$$
											\Lambda_{\Gamma}*\varphi = \lambda B \varphi
										$$
										which is a generalized eigenvalue-eigenvector problem. Hence, the identified response vector is the associated with the maximum generalized eigenvalue.
										(the entire solution is showed in the appendix)

										<h2>Emerging Commodity exporters</h2>
									</header>
									<p>
										<span class="image left"><img src="images/Figures/Groups/FEVNF_ECX.svg" alt="No fundamental ECX" /></span>
										In the group of emerging markets the long run contributions of only-related commodity innovations oscillate in the interval [17:24] percent
										of the domestic economy fluctuations. In all the cases, the pattern is increasing in the whole horizon, with the lowest instantaneous impact 
										on financial variables - real interest rate and effective exchange rates, where only explain 3 percent in the same period of the shock. 
									</p>
									<p>
										This type of innovation have a sizable impact on investment determining close of 16 percent of its variability after 2 years while only 10
										percent of the predictability on production and consumption in the same timespan. The participation
										of non-fundamental shocks as determinant of trade balance for these economies is contrasting with the outcome for developed markets, although
										in both scenarios non-fundamental commodities-related shocks explains around 21 percent of the trading forecastibility, emerging markets takes
										more time to be affected for them. As later will be exposed, this behave is not contraintuitive in the sense that emerging countries does not 
										make a good work disentangling commodity price movements into their components reacting closely in both cases, while  developed markets could 
										anticipated better global shocks.
									</p>
									<header class="main">
										<h2>Developed Commodity exporters</h2>
									</header>
									<p>
									<span class="image right"><img src="images/Figures/Groups/FEVNF_DCX.svg" alt="" /></span>
									In comparison with the results in emerging countries, we can distinguish two kinds of patterns in the contribution of non-fundamental shocks
									on advanced small open economies. On one side, an almost constant participation on consumption and trade balance, around 23 percent; and the other
									side, an increasing contribution  more evident in exchanges rates that comes from 3 percent in the short run (instantaneous), passing through 11 percent after 2 years,
									to finish explaining one fifth of its variability.	
									</p>
									<p>
										The exposure of production and investment are lower than in developing markets, with a explanation power of 11 and 15 percent respectively in the long run.
										The former is less than half the impact of global shocks while both innovations are important on investment decision.
