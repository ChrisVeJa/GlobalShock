										<h2>Impact on global variables</h2>
									</header>
									
									<p>
										The first step to verify if commodity prices are reflecting and mostly in line with global fluctuations is to compare
										how these identified shocks explain the forecastability of the exogenous block. This comparison is showed in figure
										\ref{fig:gstoworld} that plots the contribution of each identified shock to the FEV on every external variable by
										country-group.
									</p>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/Figures/World/Comparison.svg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>
										We can observe clearly that global shocks are the main source of predictability for real and financial variables in both
										groups, explaining around 30 percent of global production fluctuations and 37 percent of BAA-spread movements in the
										long run. The difference in participation is more drastic in the short run when fundamental global shocks drive world
										production predictability by around 85 percent instantaneously and 64 percent after 2 years. For the same variables, and
										in both groups, the non-fundamental commodity-related shock determines almost nothing in the short run, and as the
										discrepancies between the underlying drivers and the prices traded in the market settle down, their importance increases
										until 10 percent for DCXs and 15 percent for emerging markets for production, and 20 and 25 percent (respectively) on
										interest rates.
									</p>
									<p>
										What happen with the forecastibility of terms of trade? In both groups the non-fundamental
										shock has a high explanation power in the short run being close to 55 percent for developed economies and 61 percent in
										emerging markets. In the case of DCXs, both innovations reach similar level of explanation power - around 30 percent,
										however for emerging economies there is a disconnection at this level, the global trends do not driving a large portion
										of commodities variations, determining one quarter in the long run, while non-fundamental shocks explain 40 percent.
									</p>
									<p>
										I can drawn two consequences from these results:
										<ul>
											<li>
												There are and assymetry in how global shocks are transmitted to terms of trade depending
												on the development of the country, being more important as the economy is more developed, maybe
												because their interconnection with global financial markets which allows them to cover against
												possible idiosyncratic movement in commodity prices.
											</li>
											<li>
												Both, global and non fundamental shock are source of volatility in terms of trad, but their differ in the channels
												through which operate. The global shock exhibit a hump shape reflecting possible adjustment in investment schedules,
												stock policy, then it converges to their long run value. Meanwhile, non fundamental shocks look as the misalignments
												between the market prices and their fundamentals which are more present in the short run.
											</li>
										</ul>
									</p>
										By construction, these shocks are orthogonal, but how differs their behave between groups, and more critical, are they
										being transmitted by different mechanisms? To reply this question, in figure \ref{fig:compirf}, I plot the impulse
										response functions by group and shocks which can give us a better understanding relative to their size jointly with
										their mechanisms.
										We can observe that for every macro aggregates in the real market (production, consumption, and investment)
										fundamental global shocks response has a higher amplification than non-fundamental ones. Moreover, the dynamics of the
										impulse response for consumption differs between countries groups; while a non fundamental shock causes an increase in
										consumption, it leads a reduction for developed markets revealing a precautionary saving mechanism which si activated by
										the increment in uncovered volatility.

									<p>
										An essential reason why countries should bother about distinguishing between these shocks are their effect in
										effective exchange rate, and real interest rates. When a global shock occurs, it appreciates the domestic currency,
										reducing then drastically in the following periods, differently, a persistent misalignment in commodity prices generates
										a continuous appreciation with longer half-life.
									</p>
									<p> 
										A last source of asymmetry between country groups comes from the effect on trade balance and real interest rates.
										For DCXs both shocks increase the trade balance, however for emerging markets it origins a reduction in the ratio net
										exports - GDP because the effect on investment (hence production) should be higher that the raising in net exports. In
										addition, the response of real interest rates are negative when the economies face a non fundamental shock, but positive
										in case of an innovation in global conditions.
									</p>
									<p> 
										Finally, \textit{what is dimension of misreporting of using commodity prices are proxy of global conditions?} To
										address it, I will calculate the difference between the impulse response of an identified global shock versus an
										\textit{identified} news-augmented terms of trade shock as in ZPV in every bayesian drawn that were used in the first
										part of the document.

										Figure \ref{fig:compIRF} shows the median difference as well a 68 percent confidence bands. These differential are
										significant for emerging markets (left panel), but not for developed small open economies, due the tight connection (or
										low misalignment) between terms of trade and global conditions. It means that when we analyze an emerging small economy
										in our models we should not use only terms of trade as proxy of global conditions because they are not a sufficient
										statistic for global conditions
