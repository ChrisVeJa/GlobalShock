										<h2>Impact on global variables</h2>
									</header>
									
									<p>
										The first step to verify if commodity prices are reflecting and mostly in line with global
										fluctuations is to compare how these identified shocks explain the 
										forecastability of the variable in the domestic block. In order to do that, we calculate
										the contribution of each one to the forecast error variance by group of countries. 
										The results are plot in the following graph:</p>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/Figures/World/Comparison.svg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>
										We can observe clearly that global shocks are the  main source of predictability in real and financial 
										variables in both groups, explaining around 30 percent of the fluctuations in global production (near
										to 85 in the same quaterly, and 64 percent after 2 years), and 37 percent on the BAA spread movements. 
										For the same variables, and in both groups, the non-fundamental commodity-related shock explaing almost
										nothing in the short run, and as the discrepancies between the underlying drivers and the prices 
										traded in the market settle down, their importance increases until 10 (developed economies) percent,
										and 15 percent (emerging markets) in the long run for production, and 20 and 25 percent (respectively)
										on interest rates.
									</p>
									<p>
										<b><i> What happen wioththe forecastibility of terms of trade?</i></b> In both groups the non-fundamental
										shock has a high explanation power in the short run being close to 55 percent for developed economies and 
										61 percent in emerging markets. In the case of developed countries, in the long run both innovations explain
										similar portions of their terms of trade (around 30 percent), however for emerging economies there is a 
										disconnection in this level, cause the global trends does not driving a large portion of their relevant
										price as non-fundamental ones, with a participation in the long run near to 25 percent for the former and
										40 percent for the later. 
									</p>
									<p>
										I can drawn two consequences from these results:
										<ul>
											<li>
												There are and assymetry in how global shocks are transmitted to terms of trade depending 
												on the development of the country, being more important as the economy is more developed, maybe
												because their interconnection with global financial markets which allows them to cover against
												possible idiosyncratic movement in commodity prices.
											</li>
											<li>
												Both, global and non fundamental shock are source of volatility in terms of trad, but their differ
												in the channels through which operate. The global shock exhibit a hump shape reflecting possible 
												adjustment in investment schedules, stock policy, then it converges to their long run value. Meanwhile,
												non fundamental shocks look as the misalignments between the market prices and their fundamentals
												which are more present in the short run.
											</li>
										</ul>
									</p>
									By construction these shocks are different (they are orthogonal), but how differs the registered behave between groups,
									and more critical, are they shock being transmitted by different mechanisms? To reply this question, I plot in the next graph:
									(a) the contribution to the FEV -left panel, and (b) the impulse response by group and shocks - right panel.
									<p>

									<p>
										The blue color represents the developed economies and the solid lines the global shocks. At this point, we need to remark
										the difference in the contribution on consumption reported by each group, for small open economies, the global shock 
										are the more important source of volatility, in contraposition non fundamental shocks are more relevant for develop economies. 
										In almost all the domestic variables global shocks explains more the forecastability  in emerging markets rather than in developed
										countries.
									</p>
									<p>
										In terms on size, the impulse response can give us a better understanding jointly with a comparison of mechanisms.
										In this line, we can observe that for all the real market macro aggregates (production, consumption, and investment)
										global shocks hits are more severe than non-fundamental ones (solid lines are above marker lines). Moreover, the
										dynamics of the impulse response for consumption differs between countries groups; while a non fundamental shock causes an
										increase in consumption, it leads a reduction for developed markets revealing a precautionary saving mechanism given the
										increment in uncovered volatility.
									</p>
									<p>
										An essential reason why countries should bother about distinguish between these shocks are their effect in effective
										exchange rate, and real interest rates, while a global shock appreciates the domestic currency to reduce drastically 
										in the following periods (in line with the PIH hypothesis), a persistent misalignments in commodity prices generates 
										a continuous appreciation with longer half-life. 
									</p>
									<p>
										A last source of asymmetry in this part comes from the effect on trade balance; for developed economies both shocks 
										increase the trade balance, however for emerging markets (even with distinct patterns) it origins a reduction in
										the ratio net exports - GDP because the effect on investment (hence production) should be higher that the raising 
										in net exports. In addition, the response of real interest rates are negative when the economies face a non fundamental
										shock, but positive in case of an innovation in global conditions.
									</p>
									<p>
										Finally,  what is dimension of misreporting of  using commodity prices are proxy of global conditions? 
										To address this I will calculate the difference between the impulse response of an identified global shock versus
										a news-augmented terms of trade shock. To construct this differential I apply and calculated the related IRFs for 
										each bayesian drawn that is used in the first part of the document.
									</p>
									<p>
										The next figure plots the median of the difference as well the a 68 confidence interval percent. 
										In the case of emerging markets (left panel) these differential are significant, but not for developed
										small open economies, it is caused for tight connection (or low misalignments) between their terms of trade
										and the global conditions. Instead of for developing economies the low financial markets development makes that
										these economies response differently when they face those shocks. It means, that when we analyse a small economy
										which is an emerging on, our models should not use only terms of trade as proxy of global conditions
